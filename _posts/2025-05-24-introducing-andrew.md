Welcome to my blog. I'm Andrew Ward - self-proclaimed data geek and a Fortune 10 Senior Manager of Data Engineering.

I've ignored my personal GitHub long enough, so it's time to change that.  I plan to share:
- Deep dives into data engineering strategy, tooling, and architectures
- Lessons I've learne along the way
- Practical experiments in AI, automation, and real-world productivity hacks  
- Tutorials, frameworks, and infrastructure code I find useful or build myself  

If you're a data leader, a builder, or someone excited by what's possible with the right mindset and tools â€” I hope this becomes a place you come back to.
