Hi, I’m **Andrew Ward**, a senior manager of data engineering at a Fortune 10 company.

I lead global teams through large-scale transformations involving **Azure**, **Databricks**, **CI/CD**, **Delta Lake**, and **SAFe Agile**. I'm focused on **operational excellence**, building self-service data platforms, and enabling teams through trust, standards, and automation.

Outside of work, I’m a:
- 🧠 AI enthusiast — I use tools like **ChatGPT** to scale productivity and unlock creativity
- 🎓 Lifelong learner — always sharpening my technical, leadership, and architectural skills
- 🏋️‍♂️ Personal trainer — health and wellness are central to how I show up every day
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Husband and father — building a life of impact, service, and stability

This blog is my way of sharing what I’ve learned — the frameworks, insights, tools, and lessons that help me (and hopefully you) build meaningful, scalable, and modern systems.

If you'd like to connect, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewward4/).
